Welcome to My Portfolio Repository!

Hello! I'm Anne Klein, a member of the ABA team that developed the innovative StyLEst app. This repository showcases my individual contributions and learnings from our collaborative project.

In this portfolio, you'll find:
- My personal contributions to the StyLEst project
